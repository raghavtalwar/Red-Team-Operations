## Lab 1.1 - Environment Orientation
### Lab Environment 
This course will stress the importance of redirecting traffic from the target environment to our command-and-control servers.
- Although we are attached to the target environment via the VPN, we want to ensure we logically separate the assets belonging to the target (red space) from our redirectors in our attack infrastructure (gray space) and our C2 servers and VMs (blue space).
#### Objectives
1. Understand the lab environment for the course
2. Preview labs for the course
3. VM review
