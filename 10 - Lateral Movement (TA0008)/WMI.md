### Technical Overview
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is Microsoft's implementation of the Web-Based Enterprise Management Model and can be used for a wide variety of tasks.


###### 
WMI is loved by adversaries since it can be used as a trigger based mechanism to execute arbitrary code and is therefore an ideal persistence mechanism. (for example, trigger a C2 channel when the computer has been turned on for at least 1 hour)
