### Technical Overview
An all time classic in the realm of persistence are scheduled tasks as they form a reliable execution method thanks to their trigger based controls. 
- Through some Remote Process Call (RPC) logic, it is possible to schedule and execute tasks remotely, making it a decent lateral movement mechanism as well. 

###### OPSEC
As with all lateral movement techniques, be careful of your OPSEC as of course numerous events get logged when creating and executing a scheduled task.
