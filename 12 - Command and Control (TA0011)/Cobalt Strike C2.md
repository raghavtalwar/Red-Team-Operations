## Conclusion
- In this lab we explored another command and control framework. 
- We created a listener and a PowerShell launcher. 
	- We RDP'd directly into the environment and used a download cradle to retrieve and execute our launcher. 
	- We explored a few of the tasks/modules that the framework provides including how to transform our shorthaul into an interactive haul instead.
